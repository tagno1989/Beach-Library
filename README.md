# Beach-Library
First JavaScript project For the odin project's, JS course.  

 Used Js to define a book then merged that book with user data, then posts said data to the dom and thus the screen creating books ontop of books.  
 
 Users can add or delete books and the books are saved on to the users local storage so users have the ability to create their own beach library.
